# My solution to Assignment 2
drawing the boundaries and goals
 - draw the boundaries and goals by using quickShapes_.DrawLines()

working the ball part
 - check if the position of ball is in the boundaries, if not then bounce back from the wall
 - if the ball is in the range of goals, then relaunch the game

working the car part
 - moving the car by changing its position and velocity
 - if the car it is out of boundaries, then make it position as the same.

working car/ball collision
 - if the distance between car and ball is less than the sum of their radius, then detect a collision and change the velocity of ball to let it flying from the car.
